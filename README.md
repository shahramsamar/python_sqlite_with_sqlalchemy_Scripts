# Python SQLite with SQLAlchemy Scripts

A set of Python scripts demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with SQLite using SQLAlchemy as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool. This project is designed to showcase the use of SQLAlchemy to interact with SQLite databases, providing an abstraction over SQL for smoother database operations.

## Features

- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Perform CRUD operations without writing raw SQL.
- **SQLite Database**: Lightweight, serverless database solution ideal for local projects and testing.
- **CRUD Operations**: Includes scripts for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** for managing dependencies

### Libraries
